# ffta2-hex-editor-prototype
Old code for my hex editor in C# for a nds game, built in visual studio as a winform app
Original program was lost awhile ago with an old laptop and I have other projects to work on now. Anyone who wants to use this for modding nds games is welcome.
Should be easy enough to adapt to different nds games as long as one has some understanding of the game's hexadecimal structure
